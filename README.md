## Description ##
A finite state acceptor was used to implement a lexical analyzer to be able to map out the patternof each token and accept lexemes as elements of the languagebased on the patterns.   On the other hand,  a one-way one-stack pushdown automata was used for the syntax analysis asmemory is needed to validate XML tag syntax
